---

- [x] **Iteration 47: Result bubble expand/collapse**
  - [x] Add a `COLLAPSE_LINE_THRESHOLD` constant (default 8 lines) — result bubbles with content exceeding this threshold are collapsed by default.
  - [x] Add local `expanded` state to `ChatBubble` (result role only). Default is `false` when content is long, `true` when short.
  - [x] Render a clipped preview of the first N lines when collapsed (CSS `line-clamp` or max-height + overflow hidden). Show a gradient fade at the bottom to indicate more content.
  - [x] Add a "Show more" / "Show less" toggle button at the bottom of collapsible result bubbles. Only rendered when content exceeds the threshold.
  - [x] Collapsed bubbles show a subtle "X lines hidden" indicator so users know there's more content.
  - [x] All new elements use `data-testid` attributes and `var(--color-*)` theming.
  - [x] E2E tests: short results are not collapsible; long results start collapsed with "Show more" button; clicking "Show more" expands and shows "Show less"; clicking "Show less" re-collapses.
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — 762 passed, 1 skipped
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 46: Auto-scroll toggle with scroll-to-bottom FAB**
  - [x] Add `autoScroll` boolean state (default `true`) — when true, chat snaps to bottom on new messages; when false, position is preserved.
  - [x] Detect when the user manually scrolls up (scroll event on messages container) and automatically disengage auto-scroll (`autoScroll → false`).
  - [x] Add a floating action button (FAB) "↓ New messages" that appears only when `autoScroll` is false AND new messages have arrived since the user scrolled away. Clicking it scrolls to bottom and re-engages auto-scroll.
  - [x] Add a lock/unlock auto-scroll toggle button in the chat toolbar (next to role filter). Icon switches between a lock-closed (auto-scroll on) and lock-open (auto-scroll off) state with tooltip.
  - [x] Re-engage auto-scroll automatically when the user manually scrolls back to the bottom of the container.
  - [x] All new elements use `data-testid` attributes and `var(--color-*)` theming.
  - [x] E2E tests: auto-scroll toggle button renders; FAB appears when scrolled up and new message arrives; FAB click scrolls to bottom; scroll to bottom re-engages lock.
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — 747 passed, 1 skipped
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 42: Unified chat input — hide capability selector behind Advanced toggle**
  - [x] Redesign input area: single message box, no prominent "Capability" field. Send button enabled with just a message.
  - [x] Add collapsible "Advanced" toggle below the input that reveals capability selector (datalist + known caps chips). Collapsed by default.
  - [x] Update `handleSend` — default to `"orchestrate"` when no capability is explicitly chosen.
  - [x] Update user bubble display: plain message text; show capability as a small badge only if explicitly chosen via Advanced.
  - [x] Update E2E tests for new input structure and default capability behavior.
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — all pass
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 43: Markdown rendering for result bubbles**
  - [x] Install `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` for tables, lists, code blocks, bold/italic.
  - [x] Replace `<pre>` in result ChatBubble with `<ReactMarkdown>` wrapped in prose styling. Keep raw JSON fallback for non-markdown responses.
  - [x] Add syntax highlighting for code blocks via `rehype-highlight` or similar lightweight highlighter.
  - [x] E2E tests: markdown renders correctly (headings, code blocks, lists, tables), JSON fallback works.
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — all pass
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 45: Mermaid diagram rendering in result bubbles**
  - [x] Install `mermaid` package (the official JS library).
  - [x] Create a `MermaidBlock` component that detects ` ```mermaid ` fenced code blocks in markdown results and renders them as SVG diagrams using `mermaid.render()`.
  - [x] Wire `MermaidBlock` into the `ReactMarkdown` code renderer in ChatBubble — when language is `mermaid`, render via `MermaidBlock` instead of `rehype-highlight`.
  - [x] Theme integration: configure Mermaid to use dark theme matching the app's `var(--color-*)` tokens. Support light/dark toggle.
  - [x] Fallback: if Mermaid parsing fails, show the raw code block with syntax highlighting (graceful degradation).
  - [x] E2E tests: mermaid code block renders an SVG, invalid mermaid falls back to code block, diagram is visible and has expected structure.
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — all pass (732 passed, 1 skipped)
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 44: Typing indicator + welcome empty state**
  - [x] Replace `⟳ Streaming…` text with animated typing indicator (three dots in a bubble, left-aligned like a result message).
  - [x] Improve empty state: centered welcome with clickable example prompts (e.g., "Summarize recent logs", "Check system health") that auto-fill the input.
  - [x] E2E tests: typing indicator visible during send, welcome prompts visible on empty chat, clicking a prompt fills the input.
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — all pass
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 40: Test Coverage Gaps and Critical Bug Fixes**
  - [x] Diagnose root cause of 35+ test failures across `settings.spec.ts` and `onboarding-tour.spec.ts`
  - [x] Fix infinite render loop in `QuickDispatchModal.tsx` — `useMemo` stabilises `allCapabilities` and `capabilitiesForSuggestion` so the suggestions `useEffect` only re-runs when the agents list or capability input actually changes; adds `isOpen` guard so the effect is skipped entirely while the modal is closed; uses functional updater `setCapSuggestions(prev => prev.length === 0 ? prev : [])` to bail out when state is already empty
  - [x] Create `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts` — Playwright global setup script that navigates to the app and persists `kubex-onboarding: {completed: true}` to a storage state JSON file before any test runs; prevents the first-run tour overlay from blocking accessible-tree queries in 40+ unrelated test files
  - [x] Update `playwright.config.ts` — add `globalSetup` pointing at the new setup script; add `storageState` pointing at `tests/state/onboarding-complete.json` so every test context inherits completed onboarding state by default; tests in `onboarding-tour.spec.ts` that need a fresh tour explicitly override via `addInitScript`
  - [x] Update `tests/e2e/settings.spec.ts` — `beforeEach` navigates directly to `/settings` and waits for `[data-testid="settings-page"]` (10 s timeout) so every test starts from a fully-loaded page; navigation tests that need the dashboard do their own `page.goto('/')` first; `settings page renders with main heading` test updated to query the h1 inside the settings container (avoiding clash with the Layout top-bar h1 "Settings")
  - [x] Rewrote `tests/e2e/onboarding-tour.spec.ts` — helper functions `activateTour()` / `completeTour()` replace old `clearOnboarding()` pattern; global storageState means tests start clean and opt-in to tour via `addInitScript` rather than post-load clearing
  - [x] Build: `npm run build` — clean, 113 modules
  - [x] Test: `npx playwright test` — 658/658 passed (1 skipped); 20 more tests now pass compared to the pre-fix 638 baseline

- [x] **Iteration 39: Auto-Refresh Countdown Indicator**
  - [x] Create `src/components/RefreshCountdown.tsx` — small circular SVG ring that visually counts down the polling interval; resets on each poll tick; shows seconds remaining as tooltip; accepts `interval` (ms) and `lastPolledAt` (Date | null) props; animates stroke-dashoffset from 0→full circumference over the interval duration; pauses gracefully when `lastPolledAt` is null; uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animation
  - [x] Add `lastHealthPollAt: Date | null` and `setLastHealthPollAt` to `AppContext` — updated by `useHealthCheck` after each successful poll cycle
  - [x] Update `useHealthCheck.ts` — call `setLastHealthPollAt(new Date())` after `setServices`
  - [x] Update `ConnectionIndicator.tsx` — import `RefreshCountdown`; render it as a small 16px ring overlaying the status dot in a relative container; pass `interval={HEALTH_INTERVAL}` (15000) and `lastPolledAt` from context; ring inherits text color so it matches status (emerald/amber/red)
  - [x] Create `tests/e2e/refresh-countdown.spec.ts` (22 tests) — countdown ring present on all 6 pages; SVG ring element present; arc element present; role=img on SVG; aria-label truthy; aria-label mentions "health check" after first poll; aria-label includes "15s"; aria-label includes remaining seconds; title tooltip matches aria-label; aria-label mentions "waiting" before poll; ring co-exists with status dot; ring inside connection indicator button; arc has stroke-dasharray; arc has stroke-dashoffset; stroke-dashoffset decreases over time (ring animates); aria-hidden=false; persists after navigation
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean (111 modules)
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test tests/e2e/refresh-countdown.spec.ts — 22/22 passed; connection-indicator.spec.ts — 24/24 passed
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 38: Quick Dispatch Modal (Ctrl+D)**
  - [x] Create `src/components/QuickDispatchModal.tsx` — modal overlay triggered by Ctrl+D; agent selector dropdown with favorites-first sorting (using `useFavorites`) and optgroup separation; capability input with autocomplete (ArrowDown/Up/Enter navigation, mousedown-select to avoid blur race); message textarea; three-way priority selector (`low`/`normal`/`high`) as radio-group buttons; validate on submit and on blur (reuses `validateCapability` / `validateMessage`); dispatch via `dispatchTask` API; inline result panel (success/error) with aria-live; adds entry to traffic log via `addTrafficEntry`; close on backdrop click, Escape, Cancel button, or close icon; resets all form state on each open
  - [x] Wire Ctrl+D shortcut in `Layout.tsx` via `useKeyboardShortcuts` (`ctrl: true`, `allowInInput: true`, toggles `quickDispatchOpen`); Escape handler also closes quick dispatch; add `QuickDispatchModal` to JSX
  - [x] Add "Quick Dispatch" toolbar button (⚡ Dispatch, ^D hint) to top bar in `Layout.tsx`; positioned before command palette trigger; styled emerald to stand out from utility buttons
  - [x] Add `onOpenQuickDispatch` prop to `CommandPalette` interface; add `action-quick-dispatch` builtin command in "Actions" category; closes palette then opens quick dispatch modal
  - [x] Update `KeyboardShortcutsHelp.tsx` — add `{ keys: ['Ctrl', 'D'], description: 'Open quick dispatch modal' }` to Global shortcuts group
  - [x] Create `tests/e2e/quick-dispatch.spec.ts` (34 tests) — toolbar trigger visible; aria-label correct; click opens modal; Ctrl+D from Dashboard; Ctrl+D from Agents page; Ctrl+D from Traffic page; second Ctrl+D toggles closed; role=dialog aria-modal; heading text; Ctrl+D hint in header; agent select present; default selection empty; capability input present; message textarea present; three priority buttons; Normal selected by default; clicking changes priority; Dispatch button present; close button dismisses; Escape closes; backdrop click closes; Cancel button closes; empty submit shows both errors; cap error text; msg error text; cap error clears on type; invalid characters show blur error; capability has aria-autocomplete=list; command palette contains Quick Dispatch; command palette item opens modal; item in Actions category; shortcuts help includes Ctrl+D; fields empty on reopen; priority resets to Normal on reopen
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean (110 modules)
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test tests/e2e/quick-dispatch.spec.ts — 34/34 passed
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 37: Pinned/Favorite Agents**
  - [x] Create `src/hooks/useFavorites.ts` — manages a `string[]` of favorited agent IDs in localStorage under `kubex-favorite-agents`; exposes `favorites` (array), `favoritesSet` (Set for O(1) lookup), `isFavorite(id)`, and `toggle(id)` (adds if absent, removes if present); built on `useLocalStorage`
  - [x] Update `AgentsPanel.tsx` — add `useFavorites` hook; sort `sortedItems` with a stable secondary sort that lifts favorites to the top (before pagination); add `auto` star column to `grid-cols` template in both header and rows; render a "Pinned" amber section label row before the first favorited agent; render an "All Agents" separator row before the first non-favorited agent when both groups are present on the same page; each `AgentRow` receives `favorited` prop and `onToggleFavorite` callback; star button shows `★` (amber) when favorited, `☆` (dim) otherwise; click is stop-propagated to prevent row expand
  - [x] Update `AgentDetailPage.tsx` — import `useFavorites`; add amber star toggle button next to agent ID heading (between CopyButton and StatusBadge); aria-label switches between "Pin agent" and "Unpin agent"; state reflects current localStorage value
  - [x] Update `Dashboard.tsx` — import `useFavorites`; sort the dashboard agent grid by favorites-first before slicing to `AGENT_DISPLAY_LIMIT`; `AgentCard` accepts optional `pinned` prop — when true, card border becomes amber and an amber `★` appears before the agent ID
  - [x] Create `tests/e2e/favorites.spec.ts` (24 tests) — star button presence; unfilled by default; correct aria-label; click fills star; aria-label changes to "Unpin"; toggle back to unfilled; no Pinned label when none favorited; Pinned label appears after favoriting; label contains ★; All Agents separator appears; Pinned label disappears after unpinning; favorites persist across reload; localStorage key and value; unfavoriting removes from localStorage; favorited agent moves to top; top row has filled star; detail page has favorite button; detail defaults to ☆; detail click fills ★; dashboard shows pinned star; star button is focusable; star button has tabIndex 0; star click does not propagate to row expand
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean (109 modules)
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — 582/582 passed (1 skipped)
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 36: Keyboard-Navigable Tables**
  - [x] Create `src/hooks/useTableKeyboardNav.ts` — manages focused row index within a table; handles ArrowDown/ArrowUp to move focus between rows, Home key for first row, Enter to expand/activate the focused row, Space to toggle selection of the focused row; returns `focusedIndex`, `setFocusedIndex`, `handleKeyDown`, and `getRowProps` (tabIndex + id + aria-rowindex + data-nav-index + onFocus helpers)
  - [x] Update `AgentsPanel.tsx` — wire `useTableKeyboardNav` to the agent table; table container gets `role="grid"` + `aria-label` + `aria-activedescendant` + `tabIndex={0}`; each row gets stable `id`, `tabIndex`, `aria-rowindex`, `data-nav-index`, `onFocus`; focused row shows emerald focus ring (`ring-2 ring-inset ring-emerald-500/60`); Enter expands row detail; Space toggles selection; updated existing `agents.spec.ts` test to use `role="grid"` selector
  - [x] Update `ContainersPanel.tsx` — same keyboard nav pattern for kubex table rows; Space to select; updated existing `containers.spec.ts` tests to use `role="grid"` selector
  - [x] Create `tests/e2e/keyboard-nav.spec.ts` (47 tests) — agents table: role=grid, aria-label, tabIndex=0, data-nav-index/aria-rowindex/id on rows, ArrowDown to row 0, ArrowDown twice to row 1, ArrowUp back to row 0, Home key, ArrowDown 3×, focus ring present, non-focused row no ring, aria-activedescendant update, Enter expands, Space selects, click syncs focus; containers table: identical 15 tests

- [x] **Iteration 35: Collapsible Dashboard Sections**
  - [x] Create `src/hooks/useCollapsible.ts` — manages collapse state for named sections, persisted in localStorage under a caller-supplied key; `isCollapsed(id)` returns current state, `toggle(id)` flips it, `setCollapsed(id, bool)` sets explicitly
  - [x] Create `src/components/CollapsibleSection.tsx` — section wrapper with clickable header button (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `data-testid`); chevron indicator rotates -90° when collapsed; smooth height transition via `scrollHeight` measurement and `height` CSS transition; `subtitle` and `action` only shown when expanded; `role="region"` + `aria-labelledby` on content panel for accessibility
  - [x] Wire into `Dashboard.tsx` — wrap Service Health, Registered Agents, and Activity Feed sections in `CollapsibleSection`; state persisted in localStorage under `kubex-dashboard-sections`; pass `hideHeader` to `ActivityFeed` to suppress its internal header when wrapped
  - [x] Update `ActivityFeed.tsx` — add optional `hideHeader` prop to suppress built-in section header when section is owned by `CollapsibleSection`
  - [x] Create `tests/e2e/collapsible-sections.spec.ts` (22 tests) — section presence, toggle button visibility, default expanded state with `aria-expanded=true`, section titles visible, collapse interaction sets `aria-expanded=false`, toggle idempotency, localStorage persistence after collapse, expanded state leaves storage clean, persistence across page reload, multiple sections collapse independently, `aria-controls` points to panel id, panel has `role=region` + `aria-labelledby`
  - [x] Update `tests/e2e/activity-feed.spec.ts` — fix 4 tests that referenced the ActivityFeed header which now lives in the CollapsibleSection: heading selector, subtitle selector, "View all →" button selector and navigation test
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean (107 modules)
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — 529/529 passed
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

---

- [x] **Iteration 34: Task History Page**
  - [x] Create `src/components/TaskHistoryPage.tsx` — dedicated table view of dispatched tasks extracted from traffic log entries where `action === 'dispatch_task'`; columns: task_id, agent_id, capability, status, dispatched_at; expandable rows show full result/error details; uses `useSearch`, `useSort`, `usePagination`, `useQueryParams`; status filter (all/pending/allowed/denied/escalated); search across task_id, agent_id, capability; sort by dispatched_at, agent_id, status; expandable detail row with JSON pretty-print of entry details

---

- [x] **Iteration 12: Wire AuthGate into App tree + replace polling with SSE in OrchestratorChat**
  - [x] Wrap App.tsx route tree with `<AuthGate>` so unauthenticated users see the token prompt before any route renders (AuthGate was built in iteration 3 but never placed in the component tree — it is currently dead code)
  - [x] Remove the manual `setInterval` polling loop from OrchestratorChat.tsx (`pollIntervalRef`, `POLL_INTERVAL`, `POLL_MAX` constants, and the `setInterval` block inside `handleSend`)
  - [x] Replace polling with `useSSE` hook: after `dispatchTask` succeeds, pass the task stream URL (`/tasks/{taskId}/stream`) to `useSSE`; map incoming SSE chunk types (`stdout`, `stderr`, `result`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `hitl_request`) to the appropriate `addMessage` calls and traffic entries
  - [x] Embed `<TerminalOutput>` inside the result bubble when a stream is active so live stdout/stderr chunks render incrementally rather than as a single final blob
  - [x] Embed `<HITLPrompt>` inside OrchestratorChat when the stream emits a `hitl_request` chunk (the component was created in iteration 8 but OrchestratorChat never wired it)
  - [x] Update the `sending` spinner text to reflect SSE states: "Connecting…" / "Streaming…" / "Waiting for result…" based on `useSSE` status
  - [x] Add `getTaskStream()` URL builder to api.ts if not already returning a full URL suitable for `EventSource` (currently only added to api.ts signature, confirm it returns the bare URL string)
  - [x] Create tests/e2e/authgate.spec.ts — (a) no token → AuthGate renders before any nav link; (b) valid token entered → app tree becomes visible; (c) env token set → AuthGate is bypassed
  - [x] Extend tests/e2e/streaming.spec.ts — add test that OrchestratorChat no longer issues repeated GET /tasks/{id} poll requests after dispatch (assert XHR log has ≤1 task result fetch)
  - [x] Verify: npm run build clean + npx playwright test passes (128/128)

- [x] **Iteration 13: Replace ad-hoc loading/empty states with SkeletonLoader + EmptyState**
  - [x] **AgentsPanel.tsx** — replace the inline `[1,2,3].map(i => <div animate-pulse>)` skeleton with `<SkeletonTable rows={3} cols={5} />`; replace the local `EmptyState` function component with the shared `<EmptyState icon="◎" title="No agents registered" description="Run docker compose up to start agents." />`
  - [x] **ContainersPanel.tsx** — replace the inline `[1,2,3].map(i => <div animate-pulse>)` skeleton with `<SkeletonTable rows={3} cols={5} />`; replace the local `EmptyContainers` function component with the shared `<EmptyState icon="⬡" title="No kubexes found" description="Kubexes appear here when spawned via Manager." />`
  - [x] **AgentDetailPage.tsx** — replace the bespoke two-div loading shimmer (lines 47–52) with `<SkeletonCard />` followed by `<SkeletonText lines={4} />`; replace the ad-hoc error/not-found block with `<EmptyState icon="⚠" title="Agent not found" description={error} action={{ label: '← Back to Agents', onClick: () => navigate('/agents') }} />`
  - [x] **Dashboard.tsx** — replace the inline `<span className="animate-pulse">Loading agents…</span>` block with `<SkeletonCard />` cards matching the agent card grid layout; replace the local `EmptyState` function at the bottom of the file with the shared component
  - [x] **ApprovalQueue.tsx** — replace the hardcoded empty-state `<div>` (lines 49–56) with `<EmptyState icon="✓" title="No pending approvals" description="Escalated actions from the policy engine will appear here." />`; add loading state using `<SkeletonCard />` (2 cards) while initial data resolves
  - [x] Delete all local `EmptyState`/`EmptyContainers` function declarations that were copy-pasted into individual component files — they are now superseded by the shared component
  - [x] Create tests/e2e/skeletons.spec.ts — intercept API routes with a delayed handler; assert `aria-busy="true"` skeleton elements appear during load; assert they disappear and real content renders after the response resolves

  - [x] Export `deriveSystemStatus()` helper and `INITIAL_SERVICES` constant from `AppContext`
  - [x] Create `src/hooks/useHealthCheck.ts` — runs health checks on a 15 s interval globally; writes results into `AppContext.services`; replaces per-component health logic

  - [x] Mount `useHealthCheck()` in `Layout.tsx` so health runs on every page (not just Dashboard)
  - [x] Replace static `[role="status"] live` badge in `Layout.tsx` top bar with `<ConnectionIndicator />`
  - [x] Refactor `Dashboard.tsx` — remove own `services` state and `checkHealth` callback; read `services` from `AppContext` instead; no longer calls `getGatewayHealth` / `getRegistryHealth` / `getManagerHealth` / `getBrokerHealth` directly
  - [x] Fix 4 pre-existing tests that targeted the old static badge (accessibility, integration, responsive)

  - [x] Add `<ActivityFeed>` to `Dashboard.tsx` after the agent overview section; reads `trafficLog` from `AppContext`; "View all →" button calls `onNavigate('traffic')`
  - [x] Create `tests/e2e/activity-feed.spec.ts` (12 tests: section renders, heading, empty state, rows from localStorage, row content, 10-row cap, subtitle count, denied/escalated border accents, view-all button, view-all navigates to Traffic, aria-label on list)
  - [x] Fix `tests/e2e/dashboard.spec.ts` "View all →" test — scoped to Registered Agents section to avoid strict-mode violation with new Activity Feed "View all →"

  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — 493/493 passed
  - [x] Mark [x], commit

- [x] **Iteration 32: OAuth Authentication Scaffolding**
  - [x] Create `src/services/auth.ts` — OAuth service layer: `login()` (PKCE redirect), `handleCallback()` (code exchange), `refreshToken()`, `logout()`, `getAccessToken()`, `isAuthenticated()`, `getUser()`, `isOAuthConfigured()`; all URLs configurable via `VITE_OAUTH_AUTHORITY`, `VITE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `VITE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`; falls back to legacy bearer token when OAuth env vars are not set
  - [x] Update `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` — integrate OAuth service; add `oauthEnabled`, `isAuthenticated`, `user`, `login()`, `logout()` to context; backward-compatible: all existing consumers (`token`, `setToken`, `isConfigured`, `clearToken`) continue to work unchanged
  - [x] Create `src/components/LoginPage.tsx` — full-screen sign-in page with "Sign in with OAuth" button; shown only when `oauthEnabled=true` and user is not authenticated
  - [x] Create `src/components/UserMenu.tsx` — top-bar avatar + name dropdown with logout; displays OAuth user profile (name, email, avatar) or "API Token" label in legacy mode; closes on Escape and outside click
  - [x] Create `src/components/AuthCallbackPage.tsx` — handles OAuth redirect; exchanges code for tokens via `handleCallback()`; shows loading spinner during exchange and error state on failure; redirects to `/` on success
  - [x] Update `src/App.tsx` — add `OAuthGate` wrapper (shows LoginPage when OAuth configured + not authenticated; handles callback route); add `/auth/callback` route; lazy-load both new pages
  - [x] Update `src/components/Layout.tsx` — add `<UserMenu />` to top bar between NotificationCenter and the divider
  - [x] Update `src/api.ts` — `managerHeaders()` calls `getAccessToken()` (prefers OAuth token, falls back to static `VITE_MANAGER_TOKEN`)
  - [x] Update `docs/FE-BE-REQUESTS.md` — add OAuth endpoints section (entries 21–24): `/authorize`, `/token`, `/userinfo`, `/logout`; note JWT validation requirements for Manager/Gateway
  - [x] Create `tests/e2e/oauth.spec.ts` (16 tests) — legacy mode compatibility, login page visibility, callback route registration, UserMenu accessibility, PKCE storage, OAuthGate pass-through
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean

  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 31: URL query params for shareable filters**
  - [x] Create `src/hooks/useQueryParams.ts` — typed wrapper around React Router's `useSearchParams`; reads initial values from URL on mount; omits params that equal their defaults to keep URLs clean; `push=true` for discrete filter changes (navigable back/forward), `push=false` for incremental keystrokes (replaceState)
  - [x] Update `src/hooks/useSearch.ts` — add optional `initialQuery` param to seed search state from URL on mount
  - [x] Update `src/hooks/useSort.ts` — accept optional `initialSortConfig` param to restore sort state from URL on mount
  - [x] Wire `useQueryParams` into `AgentsPanel.tsx` — search, sort key+direction, page persisted in URL; handlers update URL on user action; initial values restored on direct navigation or page refresh
  - [x] Wire `useQueryParams` into `ContainersPanel.tsx` — search, status filter, sort key+direction, page persisted in URL; status filter uses pushState (discrete); search uses replaceState (incremental)
  - [x] Wire `useQueryParams` into `TrafficLog.tsx` — status filter, agent filter, search, page persisted in URL; discrete filter changes push history; search keystrokes replace
  - [x] Fix `tests/e2e/streaming.spec.ts` — replace `waitForTimeout(2000)` with `waitForFunction` polling for the expected element to appear, eliminating pre-existing flakiness in 2 tests
  - [x] Update `playwright.config.ts` — add `workers: 4` to prevent parallel-execution race conditions against the real backend that caused 6 intermittent failures under 12 workers
  - [x] Create `tests/e2e/query-params.spec.ts` (25 tests) — covers AgentsPanel URL params (8 tests), ContainersPanel URL params (7 tests), TrafficLog URL params (6 tests), cross-panel isolation (3 tests) + end-to-end shareability test
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean, 98 modules
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — 450/450 passed
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 30: Click-to-copy for IDs and results**
  - [x] Create `src/components/CopyButton.tsx` — small icon button that copies text to clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText`; shows "Copied!" feedback for 1.5 s then reverts; accessible with `aria-label`, `title`, keyboard-operable
  - [x] Add `<CopyButton>` next to Agent IDs in `AgentsPanel.tsx` rows (expanded detail) and `AgentDetailPage.tsx` Overview tab
  - [x] Add `<CopyButton>` next to Kubex IDs in `ContainersPanel.tsx` rows
  - [x] Add `<CopyButton>` next to task IDs in `OrchestratorChat.tsx` result bubbles and copy-result button for full result content
  - [x] Add `<CopyButton>` next to task IDs in `TrafficLog.tsx` rows
  - [x] Create `tests/e2e/copy-button.spec.ts` — tests: button renders, clipboard write called, "Copied!" feedback shown, button in agent panel, button in containers panel, button in orchestrator result, button in traffic log
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean, 97 modules
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — 425/425 passed
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 29: Agent capability matrix**
  - [x] Create `src/components/CapabilityMatrix.tsx` — grid/table showing agents as rows and all unique capabilities as columns; filled cells (✓) indicate the agent has that capability; empty cells (–) indicate it does not; coverage count per column shows how many agents share each capability; agent status dot in each row; columns sorted alphabetically; horizontal scroll for wide fleets; full `aria-label` accessibility on every cell; `role="grid"` with `aria-label` on the table
  - [x] Add `<CapabilityMatrix agents={agents}>` to `AgentsPanel.tsx` — rendered below the table + pagination when `agents.length > 0`; updates whenever the polling refresh returns new agent data
  - [x] Create `tests/e2e/capability-matrix.spec.ts` (17 tests)
  - [x] Fix `tests/e2e/export.spec.ts` — update 4 agent export tests to use `.first()` to avoid Playwright strict-mode violation caused by the matrix now rendering agent IDs a second time on the same page
  - [x] Fix `tests/e2e/skeletons.spec.ts` — update 1 test with `.first()` for same reason
  - [x] Build: npm run build — clean, 96 modules
  - [x] Test: npx playwright test — 414/414 passed
  - [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

- [x] **Iteration 14: Performance pass — React.memo, useMemo, virtualized lists**
  - [x] **React.memo on pure sub-components** — wrapped `AgentRow` (AgentsPanel), `KubexRow` (ContainersPanel), `ApprovalCard` (ApprovalQueue), `ChatBubble` (OrchestratorChat), `ServiceCard`, `StatusBadge`, `Sparkline`, `Pagination`, and `SearchInput` with `React.memo`; each of these re-renders on every parent poll tick even when their own props have not changed
  - [x] **useMemo for derived data** — confirmed `useSearch`, `useSort`, `usePagination` each use internal `useMemo`; added explanatory comments in AgentsPanel; TrafficLog `agentIds` and `filteredEntries` both use `useMemo` with minimal dependency arrays
  - [x] **useCallback audit** — added comments in Dashboard's `loadAgents` and `loadKubexes` confirming `agentSeries.push` / `kubexSeries.push` are intentionally omitted from deps (ref-based push, stable identity)
  - [x] **Virtualized list for TrafficLog** — @tanstack/react-virtual NOT added (too heavy per task spec); existing pagination (20/page) already limits DOM nodes; localStorage cap verified at 500 entries in AppContext (`addTrafficEntry` slices to 500); cap confirmed by test
  - [x] **Clear chat button added** — added "Clear" button to OrchestratorChat input area; clears messages to initial welcome message; unbounded chat list is managed by pagination via future work
  - [x] **Code-split ApprovalQueue and AgentDetailPage** — both already `lazy()`-imported in App.tsx; chunk sizes documented in comment block at top of App.tsx (gzip: Dashboard 3.1 KB, OrchestratorChat 4.1 KB, index bundle 66 KB)
  - [x] **localStorage Date rehydration bug fixed** — AppContext now rehydrates ISO string timestamps back to `Date` objects on load (both `trafficLog` and `chatMessages`); fixes crash when app loads with persisted entries
  - [x] Create tests/e2e/performance.spec.ts — 12 tests: pagination limits DOM (far fewer than 200 rows), localStorage cap at 500, rapid navigation doesn't crash, no ResizeObserver errors, page load times under 3s, memo components render correctly, Clear chat button present
  - [x] Verify: npm run build clean + npx playwright test passes (154/154)
  - [x] Commit
